The application is configured to span all Availability Zones in the region and is Auto-Scaled based on the CPU utilization of the web servers. Notifications will be sent to the operator email address on scaling events. The instances are load balanced with a simple health check against the default web page. Amazon Linux is chosen as the ami. Please proivde a public facing VPC and atleast two subnets(default) with internet access for application load balancer to function".
